✅ 1. Assumption Checks
Box’s Test (Equality of covariance matrices)
p = .481 → NOT significant
✔ Assumption met — no covariance differences between treatment groups.
Mauchly’s Test of Sphericity
W = .860, p = .705 → NOT significant
✔ Sphericity assumption is satisfied.
→ You can use the Sphericity Assumed rows in your ANOVA table.
Levene’s tests for each time point
All p-values > .40
✔ Variance equality across Treatment groups at each time point is satisfied.
Conclusion:
All assumptions for repeated-measures ANOVA are met.

✅ 2. Main Effects
A. Within-Subjects Effect (Time / factor1)
From Tests of Within-Subjects Effects:
F(3,63) = 59.156, p < .001
✔ Very strong evidence that soil quality changes significantly over time.
Support from contrasts:
Linear trend p < .001
Quadratic & cubic not significant
➡ Soil quality changes in a steady, linear increase over time.
B. Between-Subjects Effect (Treatment)
From Between-Subjects Effects:
F(2,21) = 20.224, p < .001
✔ Treatments differ significantly in overall soil quality.
Post hoc tests (Tukey, Bonferroni):
B > A (difference ≈ 4.02, p = .001)
B > C (difference ≈ 5.97, p < .001)
A vs C → not significant
➡ Treatment B produces the highest soil-quality overall.
➡ Treatment A is slightly higher than C, but not significantly.
This matches your descriptive means:
A ≈ 43.1
B ≈ 47.1
C ≈ 41.1

✅ 3. Interaction Effect (Time × Treatment)
Multivariate tests
p-values: .056, .068, .081 → marginal but not significant
Repeated-measures ANOVA table
Sphericity Assumed: F(6,63) = 1.98, p = .082
➡ Interaction is not statistically significant
Treatment groups do not change differently over time
—but p = .082 is close to .05, indicating a trend toward differences.
Contrasts:
Linear trend × Treatment: p = .169
Quadratic × Treatment: p = .256
Cubic × Treatment: p = .076 (borderline)
➡ Slight curvature differences may exist, but not strong enough to reach significance.
Interpretation:
All treatments increase over time in a similar pattern.
Treatment B is consistently higher at all times.

✅ 4. Interpretation of Observed vs Predicted vs Residual Plots
Although plots are not shown, SPSS typically creates:
Observed vs Predicted
Points should lie close to the diagonal line
➡ Indicates the model fits the data well.
Residuals (Standardized Residuals)
You look for:
No funneling (constant variance)
No strong outliers
Random scatter
Your Levene’s tests + linear trends suggest:
✔ Residuals are likely homoscedastic
✔ No extreme outliers
✔ The model assumptions appear valid.

🎯 Final Summary (Easy Interpretation)
✔ Soil quality increases significantly over time
(Strong linear improvement)
✔ Treatment has a strong effect
B highest, significantly > A and C
A and C do not differ
✔ Time × Treatment interaction is not significant
All treatments improve over time at roughly the same rate.
✔ Model assumptions are all satisfied
Results are reliable.
